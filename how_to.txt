This text describes:
- The order in which scripts were run
- What files are needed for each script and where they come from
- Output files needed to run other scripts, note that the scripts will generate additional output files that are important besides the ones indicated here

### TagSeq ###
Follow TagSeq pipeline as described here: https://github.com/z0on/tag-based_RNAseq
#Output: nve_counts.txt

### deseqNv.R ###
Use: Differential gene expression analysis
#Input: 
nve_counts.txt (from TagSeq pipeline)
#Important Output:
Starved.txt
Starved_GO.csv
Starved_RLDandPVALS.cvs

### GO_MWU.R ###
Use: GO term enrichment analysis of a group of genes of interest
#Input:
Starved_GO.csv (from desqNv.R) OR
green_kME.csv OR green_fisher.csv (from WGCNA.R)
#Needed:
go.obo
gomwu_a.pl
gomwu_b.pl
nrify_GOtable.pl
#Important Output:
BP_Starved_GO.csv

### GO_heatmap.R ###
Use: Plots expression data for genes annotated with a GO term of interest
#Input:
BP_Starved_GO.csv (from GO_MWU.R)
Starved_RLDandPVALS.cvs (from deseq.R)

### WGCNA.R ###
Use: Performs Weighted Correlation Network Analysis
#Input:
nve_counts.txt
stella_wgcna_traits.csv
#Output
